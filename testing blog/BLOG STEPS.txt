Changing variable names to make it more visible:
-We can see _DIT is only used for storing a value that is not from input or output, this sounds like a buffer, so i'll set an appropiate name: (aux)
-Then we see that DAH_ is assigned in the first for to the first bit of our aux, so it sounds like a pointer to use with out aux: (p_aux)
-Name of the array given to compare will be the: (key)
-And _DIT_ is a ponter used to move int this array so: (p_key) 

i checked 233 bitwise, and the bits that make up 223 are 11011111
the bits of a are 01100001
the bits of z are 01111010
capital letters in ascii are 32 lower than lower case numbers

so in this part of the code we convert everything to uppercase, so we only compare letters in uppercase, making the conversion in sensitive to upper and lower case.

if any letter matches the key, even if its upper or lower, the 3 for will exit at the first match starting from the left

_DAH -> converts the char passed to the . or _ that corresponds. So its now called conv_2_morse

-__DIT -> function that prints

(*p_aux >='a' ? *p_aux & 223 : *p_aux) -> esto transforma a caps las letras

-DIT_ -> stores the value of the letter capitalized

code prints in morse code the string given
